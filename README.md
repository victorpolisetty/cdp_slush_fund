## Why This is Useful?

As the former president of ACM at the University of Florida, I saw firsthand how our reimbursement system was slow and lacked transparency. This project aims to fix that using blockchain tech.

### Problems Solved:

Tracking Transactions: All transactions are stored on-chain for easy verification

Reimbursements: Instant payouts via smart contracts

Approval Visibility: See who's approved funds and who we're waiting on

Consensus: Submit and track funding requests, ensuring full transparency and agreement
